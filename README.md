# Go-With-Me Fraud Detection

## Overview
This project demonstrates how to build a realtime fraud detection AI system from scratch. The end-to-end machine learning solution (a computer system that can learn from data) leverages Apache Flink (a tool for processing data streams quickly) for stream processing and implements advanced ML techniques to identify fraudulent activities in real-time. The system can process millions of transactions per second with sub-second latency (very fast response time), enabling immediate detection of suspicious activities.

## System Architecture
The system follows a streaming architecture (a design that handles continuous data flows) designed for low-latency, high-throughput fraud detection:

- **Data Ingestion**: Captures transaction data in real-time from multiple sources including payment gateways (services that process payments), banking systems, and user interactions
- **Stream Processing**: Apache Flink (replacing Spark in the original design) for advanced event time processing and stateful computations (keeping track of information over time)
- **Feature Engineering**: Real-time feature extraction and transformation (converting raw data into useful information for AI models) with both historical context and immediate transaction data
- **Model Prediction**: ML models (mathematical algorithms that make predictions) deployed for inference (using the trained model to make predictions) with optimized performance for low-latency decisions
- **Alerting System**: Immediate notification of potentially fraudulent transactions with configurable risk thresholds (customizable levels of risk sensitivity)

## Cloud Deployment
For production environments (real-world use), this system can be deployed on cloud infrastructure (computing resources provided over the internet) with the following recommendations. Our architecture is cloud-native (designed specifically for cloud environments) and can be implemented on AWS, GCP, or Azure (popular cloud service providers) with minimal adjustments.

### Key Components
- **Streaming Layer**: Managed Kafka services (pre-set up Kafka systems provided by cloud providers) (AWS MSK, Confluent Cloud, etc.)
- **Processing Layer**: Kubernetes-orchestrated (a system for automating deployment and scaling) Flink clusters with auto-scaling (automatically adjusting resources based on demand)
- **Storage Layer**: Combination of object storage (for storing files), time-series databases (for storing time-based data), and distributed databases (spread across multiple machines)
- **Monitoring**: Comprehensive observability stack (tools for monitoring system health) with distributed tracing (tracking requests through the system)
- **Deployment**: GitOps workflow (automated deployment from code repositories) with CI/CD pipelines (continuous integration/continuous delivery - automating testing and deployment)

## ML Feature Modeling
The fraud detection model relies on carefully engineered features (attributes used by ML models) that capture various aspects of transactions and user behavior. Our approach combines real-time signals with historical patterns to achieve high accuracy with minimal false positives (incorrectly flagging legitimate transactions as fraudulent).

### Feature Categories
- **Transaction Features**: Core attributes of each transaction (amount, timestamp, etc.)
- **Temporal Features**: Time-based patterns and anomalies (unusual timing of transactions)
- **Behavioral Features**: User-specific patterns and deviations (changes from normal behavior)
- **Network Features**: Relationships between entities in the transaction graph (connections between users, merchants, etc.)
- **Device Features**: Characteristics of the devices used for transactions (browser type, operating system, etc.)
- **Geospatial Features**: Location-based risk signals (unusual locations, impossible travel scenarios)

### Preprocessing & Engineering
- **Standardization**: Normalize numerical features (scaling values to a standard range)
- **Encoding**: One-hot encoding for categorical variables (converting categories to binary vectors)
- **Imputation**: Handling missing values with appropriate strategies (filling in gaps in data)
- **Feature Crossing**: Creating interaction features (combining features to capture relationships)
- **Dimensionality Reduction**: When appropriate for specific models (reducing the number of features)

### Machine Learning Model Features
- **Real-time data consumption from Kafka**: Direct streaming data integration (getting data immediately as it's generated)
- **Temporal and behavioral feature engineering**: Creating time-based and behavioral patterns (making features that capture timing and behavior)
- **Class imbalance handling with SMOTE**: Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (creating synthetic examples of the minority class - fraudulent transactions) for balanced training
- **Hyperparameter tuning with RandomizedSearchCV**: Automated ML parameter optimization (finding the best settings for the model)
- **XGBoost classifier with optimized threshold**: Gradient boosting with custom decision thresholds (adjusting the sensitivity of fraud detection)
- **MLflow experiment tracking and model registry**: Version control and experiment management (keeping track of different model versions)
- **Minio (S3) integration for model storage**: Scalable artifact storage (storing model files in a way that can grow)
- **Comprehensive metrics and visualization logging**: Performance monitoring and analysis (tracking how well the model is doing)
